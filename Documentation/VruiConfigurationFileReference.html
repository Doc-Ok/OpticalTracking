<H1>Vrui Configuration File Settings Reference</H1>

Vrui's main configuration file, Vrui.cfg, is a hierarchical collection of sections containing tag/value pairs not unlike the Windows registry. The main difference is that Vrui configuration files are plain text, and that they contain strongly typed values from a rich set of types (see <A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html">Vrui Configuration File Settings Value Type Reference</A>). The outermost section in Vrui.cfg is always called &quot;Vrui,&quot; and inside that section are any number of <EM>root sections</EM> defining the configurations of separate complete Vrui environments. These root sections are typically named by the host name of the computer running the respective environment, such that the Vrui run-time can automatically configure itself to the environment in which it is run at any given time.<P>

The rest of this document lists and explains all tag/value pairs that exist within the following section types:

</TR>

<TR>
<TD>meterScale</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the physical coordinate unit used to describe the Vrui environment by specifying the length of a meter in physical units. Alternative to <EM>inchScale</EM> setting, see above. For example, if the used physical units are centimeters, <EM>meterScale</EM> is set to 100.0.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><A NAME="displayCenter">displayCenter</A></TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#point">point</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the center point of the Vrui display environment in physical coordinates. The center point is mostly used by applications to initialize their model coordinates. In general, the display center should be a point that is in the middle of the display space accessible by users, such as the screen center for a single-screen environment or the center point of a CAVE.</TD>

<TD>Defines a plane in physical coordinates that corresponds to a Vrui display environment's floor. For walk-in environments such as CAVEs or upright display walls it is typically the true floor plane; for desktop-like environments it is typically a plane orthogonal to the &quot;up&quot; direction that is placed a few feet below the screen center.<BR>
The floor plane is used by some navigation tools or applications to lock the virtual floor of a virtual environment to the real floor of the real environment, to support virtual walking.</TD>
</TR>

It is typically identical to the display center, but for single-screen environments, it is typically offset a few inches to be placed in front of the screen to simplify interaction with new virtual input devices.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>inputDeviceAdapterNames</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#list">list</A> of <A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#string">strings</A></TD>
<TD>List of names of the <A HREF="#inputdeviceadaptersections">input device adapter sections</A> that specify all sources of user input recognized by Vrui applications.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>inputDeviceDataSaver</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#string">string</A></TD>
<TD>Name of <A HREF="#inputdevicedatasaversection">input device data saver section</A>. If this is a valid section name, Vrui will save the state of all physical input devices to a file on every frame. These files can later be played back by creating a playback input device adapter. Saving input device data can be useful during debugging, to capture a session and play it back later from inside a debugger, or to generate 3D movies of someone using a Vrui application.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>updateContinuously</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#boolean">boolean</A></TD>
<TD>Flag whether to run Vrui's inner loop continuously. If this is set to false, Vrui will only update its (and the application's state) whenever new data arrives from any input devices. This is the most appropriate mode for non-immersive display environments. If set to true, Vrui will update its internal state as fast as possible, regardless of whether new input device data arrived or not. Applications that use animation will typically override this setting to run smooth animations even if no input device events arrive, or explicitly ask for state updates whenever they change their visible state.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>maximumFrameRate</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>The maximum allowed frame rate for Vrui's main loop. If this parameter is set to a value larger than zero, the Vrui main loop will pad each frame to at least the duration of 1.0/maximFrameRate seconds by blocking before advancing to the next frame. Normally Vrui applications should run as fast as they can to minimize latency; however, some special uses like generating 3D movies by saving input device data (see above) might benefit from a throttled frame rate.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>viewerNames</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#list">list</A> of <A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#string">strings</A></TD>
<TD>List of names of <A HREF="#viewersections">viewer sections</A>. Viewers define how 3D models are projected onto a Vrui display environment's <EM>screens</EM>. The first viewer in the list is considered the <EM>main viewer</EM> and is treated specially, for example, is used to determine the orientation of pop-up menus.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>screenNames</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#list">list</A> of <A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#string">strings</A></TD>

<TD>List of names of <A HREF="#windowsections">window sections</A>. Windows are the &quot;glue&quot; that bind <EM>viewers</EM> to <EM>screens</EM> and implement the OpenGL-based 3D rendering used by Vrui. In cluster-based distributed display environments, there must be a <EM>node&lt;index&gt;WindowNames</EM> tag for each cluster node (the master node is always zero; slave nodes are numbered according to their order in the <EM>multipipeSlaves</EM> list, starting at one). Any nodes with empty window lists will not open any windows, but otherwise fully participate in the Vrui application. This is useful for cluster head nodes with low-powered graphics cards, or for dedicated audio rendering nodes.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>listenerNames</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#list">list</A> of <A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#string">strings</A></TD>
<TD>List of names of <A HREF="#listenersections">listener sections</A>. Listeners define how spatial 3D sound is rendered in a Vrui environment. The first listener in the list is considered the <EM>main listener</EM>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>node&lt;<EM>index</EM>&gt;SoundContextName<BR>soundContextName</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#string">string</A></TD>
<TD>Name of a <A HREF="#soundcontextsection">sound context section</A>. Sound contexts correspond to audio devices and define how spatial 3D sound is rendered in a Vrui environment. In cluster-based distributed display environments, there must be a <EM>node&lt;index&gt;SoundContextName</EM> tag for each cluster node that is supposed to render spatial 3D sound using the OpenAL library (the master node is always zero; slave nodes are numbered according to their order in the <EM>multipipeSlaves</EM> list, starting at one).</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><A NAME="frontplaneDist">frontplaneDist</A></TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the distance in physical units of the OpenGL front clipping plane from the eye points of Vrui viewers. This defines how closely a viewer can approach 3D objects before the objects are clipped away.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>backplaneDist</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the distance in physical units of the OpenGL back clipping plane from the eye points of Vrui viewers. This defines how far a 3D object can move into the distance before it is clipped away.</TD>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD>ambientLightColor</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#color">color</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the ambient color component used in the OpenGL lighting equation. This is the light color used when no other lights are present. It should be kept at fairly low values not to wash out display contrast.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>widgetMaterial</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#material">material</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the material properties of 3D GUI widgets such as pop-up menus, dialog windows, etc.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>drawOverlayWidgets</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#boolean">boolean</A></TD>
<TD>Switches whether 3D user interface widgets are drawn in an overlay layer above all other 3D graphics. If disabled (the default), 3D widgets are integrated with other 3D graphics and drawn at the proper depth. If enabled, widgets are still drawn at proper depth, but appear to float above other graphics. This makes the user interface more desktop-like and works well in non-stereo mode, but can cause severe eye strain in stereo modes on the desktop and especially in immersive environments.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>popWidgetsOnScreen</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#boolean">boolean</A></TD>
<TD>If set to true, widgets popped up by Vrui applications will always be aligned with the main screen's plane, unless the application specifies a full widget transformation. This helps with keeping the illusion of a 2D user interface in desktop environments. This flag should not be enabled for immersive environments.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>

The total number of buttons in each button plane (see <EM>modifierKeys</EM> setting) is the number of button keys plus the number of actual mouse buttons (see the <EM>numButtons</EM> setting).</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>modifierKeys</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#list">list</A> of <A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#keyname">key names</A></TD>
<TD>Lists the set of modifier keys recognized by the Vrui mouse input device adapter. Modifier keys (and combinations thereof) allow access to several button planes to increase the total number of available buttons. For example, if LeftCtrl and LeftAlt are listed as modifier keys, Vrui will create four button planes (no modifier, LeftCtrl only, LeftAlt only, LeftCtrl+LeftAlt). Buttons are numbered sequentially inside each plane by mouse buttons first and then button keys, and then in order of planes. Planes are ordered according to modifier button combinations in LSB-first binary code. The plane with no modifiers pressed is always zero, and in the preceding example, the (LeftCtrl only) plane is 1, and the (LeftCtrl+LeftAlt) plane is 3.<BR>
<B>Note</B>: Any buttons (mouse buttons and/or button keys) that are pressed while the button plane is changed stay pressed until their button plane is selected again. This can be very useful especially in desktop-like environments.</TD>

<TD>Flag determining the relationship between the display screen containing a window and the Vrui <EM>screen</EM> describing the window's position in physical space. If this flag is set to false (the default), the associated Vrui <EM>screen</EM> is always fully mapped to the window's current position and size. If the flag is true, the Vrui <EM>screen</EM> is considered to map to the display screen containing the window instead.

<TD>navigate</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#boolean">boolean</A></TD>
<TD>Flag defining the effect of moving or resizing a panning-viewport window on the displayed 3D scene. If this flag is true, moving the window will move the 3D scene, and resizing the window will scale the 3D scene using a &quot;fake&quot; navigation tool. In effect, navigation will make a Vrui window behave almost exactly like a 3D window in desktop-centric applications, but the 3D scene will still be projected from the correct viewpoint to provide, for example, correct stereoscopic rendering.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>movePrimaryWidgets</TD><TD><A HREF="VruiCFGTypes.html#boolean">boolean</A></TD>
