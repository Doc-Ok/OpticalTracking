<H1>Geometry&nbsp;-- Templatized Geometry Library</H1>

The Geometry library provides an extensive set of generic classes to simplify many aspects of geometry programming. It contains the types and operations defining linear, affine, and projective spaces, a hierarchy of geometric transformations from translations to fully projective transformations, geometric objects such as spheres and cylinders with direct support for ray casting, classes implementing several types of parametric curves and surfaces, and several spatial data structures. All classes are as generic as possible to enable integrating them closely with applications that require geometric operations in spaces of different dimensions, and with different underlying scalar types.
