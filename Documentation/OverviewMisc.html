<H1>Misc&nbsp;-- Miscellaneous Library</H1>

The Misc library contains assorted abstraction classes such as error handling, file I/O, containers, configuration file management, etc. It is used extensively throughout the higher-level libraries.

<H2>Header Files</H2>

<DL>
<DT>SizedTypes.h</DT>
<DD>SizedTypes.h contains namespace-global type declarations for integer and floating-point types of well-defined word sizes, to guarantee matching types across binary files and network connections.</DD>

<DD>Utility.h contains namespace-global functions implementing common tasks, such as swapping variables.</DD>
</DD>

<DD>Companion to Misc::SelfDestructPointer for new[]-allocated arrays of objects.</DD>
